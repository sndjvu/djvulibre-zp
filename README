Files zp.c and zp.h repackage the Zprime-Coder binary arithmetic coder from
DjVuLibre (libdjvu) as a standalone C library. The goal is to make it easier to
test new implementations of the Zprime-Coder, in particular `sndjvu_codec::zp`.

This is a derivative work of DjVuLibre, and is made available under the same
terms (GPL version 2 or later, see LICENSE).
